# cbYubikey
YubiKey Web Services API Client

Implements the YubiCo OTP Validation Protocol as outlined at http://code.google.com/p/yubikey-val-server-php/wiki/ValidationProtocolV20

Sends a One Time Password (OTP) via HTTP get to the YubiCo API server and returns a struct based on the response.

This is a super quick rewrite as a coldbox module of a client orginially written by Robert Dudley. See as well http://yubikey.riaforge.org/
